title: Bayesian Optimization Book
---

This is a monograph on Bayesian optimization that was published in early 2023 by
Cambridge University Press.

The book aims to provide a self-contained and comprehensive introduction to
Bayesian optimization, starting “from scratch” and carefully developing all the
key ideas along the way. The intended audience is graduate students and
researchers in machine learning, statistics, and related fields. However, I also
hope that practitioners and researchers from more distant fields will find some
utility here.

The book is divided into three main parts, covering:

- theoretical and practical aspects of Gaussian process modeling,
- the Bayesian approach to sequential decision making, and
- the realization of practical and effective optimization policies.

A few additional topics are also covered:

- an overview of theoretical convergence results,
- a survey of notable extensions,
- a comprehensive history of Bayesian optimization, and
- an annotated bibliography of applications.

You can
[order a copy from Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/pattern-recognition-and-machine-learning/bayesian-optimization)
or
[from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Optimization-Roman-Garnett/dp/110842578X).

The book will remain freely available on this website for personal use.

You may download the book in several slightly different formats below. The
8"x10" version shares the same page size as what will appear in print and is
best for online viewing. US letter and A4 versions are also provided for ease of
printing.
