title: Bayesian Optimization Book
---

This is a (draft) monograph on Bayesian optimization, which will be published
in early 2022 by Cambridge University Press.

The book aims to provide a self-contained and comprehensive introduction to
Bayesian optimization, starting “from scratch” and carefully developing all the
key ideas along the way. The intended audience is graduate students and
researchers in machine learning, statistics, and related fields. However, I also
hope that practitioners and researchers from more distant fields will find some
utility here.

The book is divided into three main parts, covering:

- theoretical and practical aspects of Gaussian process modeling,
- the Bayesian approach to sequential decision making, and
- the realization of practical and effective optimization policies.

A few additional topics are also covered:

- an overview of theoretical convergence results,
- a survey of notable extensions,
- a comprehensive history of Bayesian optimization, and
- an annotated bibliography of applications.

The book is in the final stages of preparation. I am making the draft available
for initial commentary before publication. Once published, the book will remain
freely available on this website.

Please note that the draft is subject to changes.
